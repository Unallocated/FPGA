  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:284 - Map is running with the multi-threading option on. Map currently
   supports the use of up to 2 processors. Based on the the user options and
   machine load, Map will use 2 processors during this run.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 20 IOs, 19 are locked
   and 1 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1. 
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:1861 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp Inst_clock/dcm_sp_inst,
   consult the device Data Sheet.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
