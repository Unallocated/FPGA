    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    28 out of   2,278    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        24 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           88
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            43 out of      88   48%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      88    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          45 out of      88   51%
    Number of unique control sets:               5
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              26 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
